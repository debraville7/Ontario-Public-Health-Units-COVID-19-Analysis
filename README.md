## ðŸ”¹ Project Background

Ontarioâ€™s Public Health Units (PHUs) experienced uneven COVID-19 case surges and vaccination uptake during the pandemic, influenced by geography, demographics, and socioeconomic conditions. Despite widespread vaccination campaigns, certain regions and age groups continued to face disproportionate infection rates and healthcare pressures. This raises critical questions about the effectiveness of vaccination programs, equity in health outcomes, and the ability to predict and manage future waves. Without a data-driven understanding of these patterns, resource allocation and policy responses risk being reactive rather than proactive. 

**Research Question:**  
How can regional, temporal, and demographic COVID-19 data guide proactive, equitable public health decisions?

This project integrates demographic, geographic, and temporal data to:
- Identify **high-risk regions** and age cohorts  
- Evaluate the **impact of vaccination coverage**  
- Provide **early warning indicators** for healthcare system strain  
- Support **equitable response planning** across Ontario

## ðŸ”¹ Data Structure & Initial Checks

1. **Vaccination by Age & PHU** â€” cumulative doses, population denominators  
2. **Cases by Status & PHU** â€” active, resolved, deaths  
3. **Positive Case Records** â€” detailed demographics, multiple date types  

---

## ðŸ”¹ Integration Model (Star Schema)

- **Fact Table**: Vaccination metrics, Status metrics, Individual case metrics  
- **Dimensions**: PHU, Age Group, Date  
- **Multiple Date Types**: Accurate Episode, Case Reported, Test Reported, Specimen

[Entity Relationship Diagram here]

---

## ðŸ”¹ Key Metrics

- **New Cases:** Difference between cumulative positive cases on the current date and the previous date. 
- **Cases per 100k:** Normalizes cases for fair PHU and agegroup comparison. 
- **Vaccination Coverage:** Computed from cumulative counts / population.  
- **Active/Resolved/Deaths:** PHU-level daily snapshots from case reports 
- **Predictive Indicators:** Week-over-week case growth and spikes in PHUs, used as early warnings.

## ðŸ”¹ Methodology and Tools

- **SQL Server**: Data integration â†’ star schema fact table (`Date Ã— PHU Ã— Agegroup`)  
- **Python (SQLAlchemy + Pandas)**: Cleaning (missing data, duplicates, outliers)  
- **Excel**: Exploratory Data Analysis (pivot tables, charts)  
- **Tableau**: Data Visualizations, interactive dashboard

## ðŸ”¹ Executive Summary
**Overview of Findings**
Ontarioâ€™s Public Health Units (PHUs) showed uneven COVID-19 outcomes shaped by geography, demographics, and vaccination coverage. Three strategic insights emerged:
1. Certain PHUs consistently experienced higher case burdens, flagging them as hotspots for localized intervention.
2. Vaccination uptake and timing directly influenced wave intensity, with slower uptake preceding severe surges and increased coverage helping flatten later waves.
3. Healthcare capacity strain mirrored active case trends, underscoring the value of predictive monitoring and surge readiness.

## ðŸ”¹ Insights Deep Dive

### 1. Geographical Hotspots
- PHUs 2249, 2241, 2262 had **30â€“45% higher incidence** than provincial average  
- These PHUs consistently surfaced at the right tail of case distributions across waves, indicating persistent vulnerability.  
- **Recommendation:** Deploy **targeted mobile vaccination/testing units** and **localized outreach campaigns**.

### 2. Temporal Waves vs. Vaccination Uptake
- Case surges (Dec 2021â€“Feb 2022) coincided with **sub-60% coverage** in certain age groups  
- When vaccination campaigns ramped up, subsequent waves showed dampened peaks.  
- **Recommendation:** Align **vaccination pushes 2â€“4 weeks ahead** of predicted waves.

---

### 3. Demographic Disparities
Adolescents (12â€“17 yrs) and seniors (80+) peaked at **2.5Ã— higher incidence** during Omicron wave  
- These groups alternated as the highest-risk cohorts â€” youth in school/work clusters, seniors due to waning immunity.  
- **Recommendation:** **School/workplace campaigns** for youth, **booster reinforcement** for seniors.

### 4. Vaccine Effectiveness
- PHUs with >80% full coverage saw **40% lower average case rates**  
- Clear negative correlation between coverage and incidence across all cohorts.  
- **Recommendation:** Sustain **high booster uptake** in at-risk populations.

[Visualization specific to category 1]
---

### 5. Healthcare Capacity Strain 
- Active cases peaked at **>200,000** in Jan 2022, stressing provincial health systems  
- Hospital strain mirrored active case curves with a 1â€“2 week lag.  
- **Recommendation:** **Pre-deploy surge staff/resources** when active cases rise steeply.

### 6. Predictive Indicators (Early Warnings)
PHUs 2226, 2227, 2230 spiked **2â€“3 weeks ahead** of province-wide surges  
These units acted as sentinel hotspots before waves spread broadly.  
- **Recommendation:** Monitor as **leading indicators** to trigger surge planning.

## ðŸ”¹ Recommendations
Based on the insights and findings above, we would recommend the Ontario Public Health Response Team to consider the following:

- High-incidence PHUs (e.g., 2249, 2241, 2262) consistently showed cases per 100k above provincial averages. **Deploy mobile vaccination/testing units and localized communication campaigns tailored to these hotspots.**

- Vaccination uptake lagged before major case surges, amplifying wave severity. **Schedule vaccination drives 2â€“4 weeks in advance of predicted waves to preemptively boost immunity.**

- Adolescents (12â€“17) and seniors (80+) recorded 2.5 times higher incidence during Omicron. **Implement school- and workplace-based vaccination outreach for youth, while reinforcing booster campaigns for elderly populations.**

- Active case peaks directly aligned with healthcare capacity strain. **Establish surge readiness protocols (staff redeployment, supply pre-positioning) to anticipate system stress during steep case rises.**

- Early-spiking PHUs (2226, 2227, 2230) acted as sentinel indicators of province-wide surges. **Integrate predictive surveillance dashboards that monitor these PHUs and trigger early surge alerts.**

## ðŸ”¹ Assumptions and Caveats
Throughout the analysis, multiple assumptions were made to manage challenges with the data. These assumptions and caveats are noted below:

- Assumption 1(Missing or null PHU_ID and Agegroup records were excluded from the analysis to preserve integrity, as re-coding could introduce bias)

- Assumption 2(Missing vaccination counts for certain PHUs were forward-filled using the most recent available data point to maintain continuity in coverage calculations)

- Assumption 3(Inconsistent date fields (Accurate Episode vs. Reported Date vs. Specimen Date) were resolved by prioritizing Accurate Episode Date as the most reliable representation of onset)

- Assumption 4(Negative or implausible cumulative case counts were treated as reporting errors and corrected to zero)
